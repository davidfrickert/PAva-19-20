# PAva-19-20
PAva Project (Advanced Programming)

The project code is implemented under Exceptional.jl (and ExceptionalExtended.jl for the extensions).
The file Tests.jl contain the examples under the project description to be tested.
Not sure why sometimes some println's don't appear, probably some buffer issue with Julia, so if it happens please run more than 1 time.
